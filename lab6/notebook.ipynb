        "Our goal is to fine-tune a small large language model (LLM) for a new task, then prepare it for deployment on a Raspberry Pi. In this example, we will fine-tune a base model that has been pre-trained for _completion_ (i.e., to predict the next words in the input sentence) so that we can use it for _chat_.\n",
        "\n",
        "We're going to fine-tune using a technique called \"low rank adaptation\" (LoRA). Vanilla fine-tuning of LLMs requires a massive amount of GPU memory because we are directly updating the weights of the model during training. With LoRA, we train a small _adapter layer_ rather than retraining the whole model. Once we're done, we merge this small adapter layer into the original model to get our fine-tuned model.\n",

        "When we fine-tune a model, we're essentially showing it a large set of _training examples_ that we want the model's outputs to resemble. For example, if we wanted to tune a generative image model to produce images in the style of Garfield comics, we would fine-tune it on a large set of comics. By fine-tuning a model, we are nudging the weights so that the probability distribution of the output shifts toward the distribution observed in our set of training examples.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Structure:** We saw that our prompt to the base model earlier didn't result in a conversational response, but rather a rambling _completion_ of the input text. Our examples need to teach the model the structure of a conversation: a human and assistant taking turns responding to one another. We will demarcate this by `### Human:` and `### Assistant:` tags. That way, when we prompt the model with text like `### Human: Hey, how's it going today?` the model knows what comes next is a response, in the structure `### Assistant: ...`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tone:** Beyond structure, we are also teaching the model to adhere to a particular conversational tone. The tone and content of conversations in our training set will be reflected in the fine-tuned model's outputs. If we want the chatbot to take on a particular persona, or be conversant in a particular domain, we need to ensure our training set exemplifies that.\n",
